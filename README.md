To use this calculator, input a .csv file in the format:
Balance,Interest Rate,Start Month
where Balance is the current balance, Interest Rate is the interest rate (formatted 0.075, not 7.5%), and Start Month is the month the loan starts accruing interest (if it is already accruing interest, put 0).
Input this csv file into the interactive_calc.ipynb then play around with your numbers!
If the Ramsay (debt-snowball) checkbox is checked, it will assume debts are paid smallest to largest. If it is unchecked, it will assume you pay from highest accruing interest rate to lowest accruing interest rate
